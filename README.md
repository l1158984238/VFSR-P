# VFSR-P: Vertical-field Step-by-Step Registration Paradigm Based on Optical Flow
This is the official implementation for VFSR-P: Vertical-field Step-by-Step Registration Paradigm Based on Optical Flow(MICCAI).
## Abstract
In recent years, within the field of registration, most deep learning methods have concentrated on enhancing feature extraction and feature fusion capabilities, often overlooking the valuable prior knowledge accumulated by traditional algorithms. We propose a novel registration paradigm, Vertical-field Step-by-Step Registration Paradigm(VFSR-P), drawing inspiration from the Lucas-Kanade optical flow pyramid(LK) algorithm. The concept of Inertia Demons is introduced to facilitate the implicit transmission of information in the process of displacement field generation and sampling. The proposed paradigm regulates the neural network learning optical flow pyramid's operation mode, leading to the generation of a more effective and rational deformation field. Experimental results demonstrate the versatility of this paradigm, showcasing its applicability to diverse models and its favorable impact on both small displacement and large displacement registration tasks.
